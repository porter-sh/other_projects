# other_projects
Used to give direction to other programming projects I have worked on that aren't in GitHub.

## GitHub
### [VEX Robotics Final Code](https://github.com/the7dorks/the7dorks.github.io/tree/code)
All robot code is in the `code` branch. Code for the "Digital Notebook" website is in the `docs` branch, along with the other posts. Other documentation of our robots can be found in the docs branch, or simply by viewing the GitHub Pages website [here](https://the7dorks.github.io).

### [VEX Robotics Annotated Programming Skills Challenge Code](https://github.com/the7dorks/2020-annotated-robot-code)
The precursor to the final code above, that was used in the making of the winning video submission [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zw8KUQEztU).
